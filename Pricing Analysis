Pricing Strategy:

Explain how you could use SQL to analyze historical pricing data, competitor pricing, and customer behavior to recommend pricing strategies for specific products.

Table Structure:

product_prices Table:

product_id (Primary Key)
date (Date of the pricing data)
price (Price of the product on that date)
competitor_prices Table:

product_id (Foreign Key referencing product_prices)
date (Date of the competitor pricing data)
competitor_price (Competitor's price for the product on that date)
customer_behavior Table:

customer_id (Primary Key)
product_id (Foreign Key referencing product_prices)
purchase_date (Date when the customer purchased the product)
purchase_price (Price at which the customer purchased the product)
quantity_purchased (Quantity of the product purchased by the customer)
Sample Data (10 rows for each table):

product_prices Table:

Now, let's provide SQL questions for pricing strategy analysis:

1. Analyze Historical Pricing Data:

Write a SQL query to calculate the average price, minimum price, and maximum price for each product from the product_prices table over a specified time period.

SELECT product_id,AVG(price) as Average_price,MIN(price) as Minimum_price,MAX(price) AS Maximum_price
FROM product_price
GROUP BY product_id

2. Monitor Competitor Pricing:

Write a SQL query to compare the pricing of your products (product_prices) with competitor prices (competitor_prices) 
--and identify instances where your price is higher or lower than the competitor's price.

SELECT pp.product_id,pp.date,price,competitor_price,CASE WHEN price > competitor_price THEN 'Higher' 
WHEN price < competitor_price THEN 'Lower'
ELSE 'Equal' END AS Price_comparison
FROM product_price pp
JOIN competitor_prices cp
ON pp.product_id = cp.product_id AND pp.date = cp.date


3.Customer Behavior Analysis:

SQL query to analyze customer behavior by calculating the average purchase price and quantity purchased for each product (customer_behavior table).

SELECT product_id,AVG(purchase_price) as Average_purchase_price,SUM(quantity_purchased) AS Quantity_purchased
FROM customer_behavior
GROUP BY product_id
